        <h1>Debt Settlement Services</h1>
        <p>A proven alternative to bankruptcy with potential savings on enrolled debts</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Resolve Your Debt for Less Than You Owe</h2>
        <p>Debt settlement is a strategic approach to resolving overwhelming debt by negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed. This solution can provide significant relief for individuals struggling with unsecured debts like credit cards, medical bills, and personal loans.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Proven Results</h4>
            <p>Based on past results, individuals who enroll in our debt settlement program and remain through graduation see savings on their enrolled debts of approximately 40% before fees, or 22% when program fees are included.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How Debt Settlement Works</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> We assess your financial situation and determine if debt settlement is right for you</li>
            <li><strong>Enrollment:</strong> Eligible debts are enrolled in the program with customized payment plans</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Account:</strong> You make monthly deposits into a dedicated savings account</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Our team negotiates settlements with your creditors</li>
            <li><strong>Settlement:</strong> Once agreements are reached, settlements are paid from your account</li>
            <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Enrolled debts are resolved, typically in 24-48 months</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Benefits of Debt Settlement</h3>

        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h4>Important Considerations</h4>
            <p>Debt settlement may impact your credit score during the program. However, for many people already struggling with debt, the benefit of resolving overwhelming obligations outweighs the temporary credit impact. Not all debts are eligible, and not all clients complete the program. Results vary based on individual circumstances.</p>
